<p>
To be honest here, mainly bought this book because it was illustrated by Minalima and had 
interactive elements. Saying that, growing up I do not remember ever watching the Disney 
movies for this novel, so I did not have any prior knowledge of the books or what happens 
in the book. After reading I did watch the life-action movies by Disney and realise there 
is not too many differences between the novels and the Disney remake. So, in my option if 
you enjoyed the movies, I would recommend the original novels.
