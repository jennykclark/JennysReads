<p>
A book I bought because of BookTok. On BookTok, creators were talking 
how this book is very emotional. However, I did not find this novel emotional, 
yes, it is a sad story. A young woman goes throughout time with not being remembered. 
Then, she means one man who remembers her. All through the novel, you believe 
one event but that ending was a shock for me, I do not know if everyone felt 
about that ending but I enjoyed, it was not an ending I was expecting but 
it did end the novel on a good note.
