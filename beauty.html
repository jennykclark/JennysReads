To be honest here, mainly bought this book because it was illustrated 
by Minalima and had interactive elements. Additionally, it was my 
favourite Disney movie. I know, I know, Disney makes classic novels 
such as Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella kid friendly, so parts 
of the story are changed. Saying that, did not need to know that 
beauty and the beast are cousins, that was a shock for me to say 
the least. Nonetheless, it was fun to read parts of story that were 
not included in the Disney movie.
