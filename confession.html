<p>
When I bought this novel, I was not sure what I was expecting because this was 
the first book I bought outside the genre of sci-fi and crime. During my first 
read of the book, I did become confused when the chapters intertwine between 
two different decades and how this had to do with the storyline. Nevertheless, 
after my second read, I fell in love with the novel, the way Burton made 
you feel like you were involved within the charactersâ€™ lives. The novel is 
surrounded around two strong women characters, one looking for answers, the 
another who may the answers. Every little thing we do in our lives will always 
have consequences; this novel helps you realise how drastic these decisions 
can be for the further.
