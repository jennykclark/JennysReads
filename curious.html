When I was first given this book, I did not want to read it. Not 
because of the book itself or the writing but because it was 
my novel, I had to write an essay for my exams. However, after 
three years of it sitting on my bookcase, I decided to read it 
again. I realised it was a remarkable book, the way Haddon explores 
the theme of a young boy who has Asperger’s Syndrome. Throughout 
the book you are not told this, but you realise it when the book 
chapters are only the prime numbers and the writing itself is simple, 
but this does not impact the book negatively, it improves it. Each 
chapter alteration between what is happening in the book and what 
Christopher is thinking. The book is written in the point of view of 
Christopher, so it feels like you are experiencing the event within 
Christopher’s mind. 
<br>
After my initial uncertainty of this book because it brings back memory of exams, 
it was a shame I did not read it early. Would highly recommend.
