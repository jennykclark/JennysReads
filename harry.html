Another book I bought because of it illustrates by Minalima and had interactive elements. 
Growing up I did not read the Harry Potters series or ever watched the movies. It was not 
until my friend realised this and made me watch the movies. To treat myself for passing 
my first semester of university online, decided to buy the Minalima version of the 
first novel in the Harry Potter series. So before reading, I knew the series is 
meant for kids, there is no doubt about that. Throughout reading, it was only the 
Minalima’s illustrates and interactive elements, that kept me reading. As the books 
and the movies never had an influence on my childhood unlike my friends, I never had 
a connection with the characters. As a result of this, I did not get the ‘spark’ people 
talk about while reading the books.
