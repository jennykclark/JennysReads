<div id="TextInfo">
<p>
The concept of the book, is great, the reason I bought the book. 
Nevertheless, I disliked the book. The start of the book was rocky, 
I was unsure how the book was a murder mystery book, but I kept on 
reading. I found it a dull read, I lost track of the characters and 
how some characters that were introduced had relationships with 
another. In my opinion, the story idea was good, a murder mystery 
set in a retirement home, but the execution was not the best.
