<p>
This was an interesting read. I thought this book would just be about 
siblings on a road trip to scatter their grandpa’s ashes but is it so much more. 
When you continue to read, you start to realise there are dark secrets that 
are about to be uncovered. Each sibling is a dick each in their own ways, 
this makes the novel feel more real, like something you watch on a Netflix 
documentary. Each page is filled with its own suspensive, you think one 
thing is going to happen but then does not. Then your shocked at the 
outcome of the characters’ actions. The ending, that ending, after reading 
it I just sat there because I was shocked, I did not think it would happen 
but then you start to realise it all makes sense.
